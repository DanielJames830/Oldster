Where are the askers?
Nobody asked you, twerp
Child
Yeah? And you're just a kid with no money
I may be old, but at least I have wives
I'm not old, I'm immortal
Good job! You found the easiest insult!
One day you will be my age, and you will understand
Time comes for us all, you are no exception
Every second you aren't running, I'm getting closer
Did your mommy not give you enough attention?
Yeah, I'm old, but at least I came back with them milk
